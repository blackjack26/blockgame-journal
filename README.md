  <h1>Blockgame Journal</h1>
</div>

A mod for Blockgame that adds a journal to help you keep track of recipes and other useful information.\
*This mod uses the same Minecraft version required by the Blockgame server.*

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is an unofficial mod for Blockgame and is not affiliated with the Blockgame team. 

## How to Use

### Learning Recipes
When you preview a recipe at an NPCs crafting station, the recipe will be added to your journal. Each time you
view the recipe, it will be updated with the latest information.

- Items with a red background are items you have not yet learned the recipe for.
- Items with a yellow background are items you have learned the recipe for, but have since been updated.

### Viewing the Journal
To open the journal, press `J` by default, or run the command `/journal`.

The journal contains several tabs:
- **Global Search**: Search all known recipes.
- **NPC Search**: Search for NPCs and their respective recipes
- **Favorites _[Upcoming Feature]_**: Save your favorite recipes for quick access.

### Decomposing Items
When you view an item in the journal, you can decompose it into its smallest required components.
If a recipe is decomposable, there will be a button in the top right corner of the recipe page.
